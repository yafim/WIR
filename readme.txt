Here's how you should use our application:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the main page you should sign in with your facebook account. Make sure to enable location sharing!

After signing in you can press on "Enter new bill" and choose a 10 digits bill ID to check in with.

After checking in with your bill you can see your check in on the map.

On the left corner you can see a navigation bar. You can see your profile and the your bills' routes, contact us, read about us and browse our FAQ page.

We really had fun and learned a lot. We hope you will enjoy our app and see how much time and effort we've put into it :) Don't forget to like our Facebook page.

If you are not logged in you can't check. The app is social and requires a Facebook login.
